This directory contains the history of public available M_CAN user manuals.

The Linux Mainline driver for the M_CAN IP core from Bosch supports all IP revisions starting from version 3.0.2.

As the original Website http://www.bosch-semiconductors.de/ removed the older IP revision documentations, it is not possible to approve/fix the existing driver portions that handle the 'older' IP parts without having the 'old' documentation.
